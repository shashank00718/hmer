This project focuses on recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately interpret mathematical notation from images and extend this capability to automatically evaluate math tests. Future improvements will include enhanced recognition accuracy, support for complex expressions, and seamless integration with automated grading systems.
